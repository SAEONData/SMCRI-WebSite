                        The Marine Remote Imagery Platform
                        (MAR-IP), managed by SAIAB, provides
                        access to a variety of underwater
                        imaging equipment that can be used
                        to conduct exploratory and quantitative
                        surveys of benthic, demersal and pelagic
                        marine biota. The equipment includes a
                        SAAB Seaeye Falcon remotely operated
                        vehicle (ROV) capable of working down to
                        300 m depth and fitted with a 12 megapixel
                        still camera, a high definition video camera
                        and a 5 function manipulator arm for
                        collecting specimen samples.

                        education officials and other guests. Learners
                        who work on SMCRI-related topics are
                        assisted by SMCRI staff in their preparations
                        for the education symposium and ESKOM

                        Imagery Platform
                        The platform also offers a broad variety
                        of stereo-video camera systems including
                        tethered (HD video cameras; depth rating
                        = 350 m; n = 15) and untethered (HD video
                        cameras; depth rating = 1000 m; n = 2)
                        stereo baited remote underwater video
                        systems (stereo-BRUVs), pelagic stereo-
                        BRUVs (4K video cameras, depth rating =
                        50 m; n = 6) and a diver operated stereovideo
                        system (4K video cameras; depth
                        rating = 100 m; n = 1). In addition, the platform
                        offers two multi-imaging drop cameras
                        rated to 350 m depth and each fitted with
                        a downwards facing 20mp mirrorless still
                        camera and oblique facing 4K stereo-video
                        cameras, as well as diver operated still
                        camera systems. The platform includes a
                        computer laboratory with all the required
                        software for processing of imagery data,
                        a large network attached storage system
                        for the long-term archiving of all imagery
                        samples and a comprehensive biodiversity
                        data management systems linked into the
                        Specify Software system used for managing
                        biological specimen collections.
